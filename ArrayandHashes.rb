# arrays

# I want to create a prog. that gets 10 pieces of info. from user, and puts 5th back to user

# prevInfo = array.size(10)

# counter = 0 
# while counter < 10
#   puts "please enter info"
# userinput = gets
# prevInfo.push[counter] = userInput
# counter += 1
# end

# puts "#{prevInfo[4]}"

# I want a program that reads the names and ages of the one direction band members

# hash = {}
# counter = 0 

# whle counter < 10
# userInput = gets

# name = userInput
# if ciunter % 2 == 1
#   name = userInput
# else hash [name] = userInput
#   end
# end

#multiplies each value by 2

# array = []
# array.each do |value|
#   value = value * 2 
# end

# hash = {}
# hash.each do |state, pop|
# hash[state] = 
# end

# Challenge 1: Make a hash that contains
# the following values:
# "Maya FB Profile" goes with: 19
# "Cailee FB Profile" goes with 190
# "Heeba FB profile" goes with 1130
# "Corey FB profile" goes with 93
# "Grace FB profile" goes with 220
# "Megan FB profile" goes with 117

hash = {}
hash.each do |name, number|

# Challenge 2: Run your program and check
# that your hash is set up correctly
# Check that an input of "Megan FB profile" gets
# back an output of 117


# Challenge 3: Add the following value to
# the hash:
# "Anna FB profile" goes with 1190



# Challenge 4: Iterate (loop) through the hash
# and return the number of Heeba's friends (you don't
# need to write a method for this)



# Challenge 5: Iterate (loop) through the
# hash and return the user who have less
# than 950 friends (you don't need to write a method
# for this)



# Challenge 6: Iterate (loop) through the hash and return
# the user who has the most amount of friends associated
# with their Facebook profile (you don't need to write a   # method for this)



# Challenge 7: Write a method that takes in as two
# parameters a hash and a number of friends, and checks
# to see whether there is a Facebook profile in the
# hash that has that number of friends.
# if there is a user who has that number of friends,
# return that use. If there is not one,
# it should puts "no such user exists"




# Challenge 8: Write a method that takes in as two
#  parameters two hashes and returns true if both hashes  
# have the same exact users in both of them
# it should return false if there exists a user
# who is in one hash but not the other
